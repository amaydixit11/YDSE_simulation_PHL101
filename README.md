Young's Double Slit Experiment Simulation
This project is a simulation developed for the PHL101 (Physics for Engineers) course at IIT Bhilai. It is a digital implementation of the double-slit experiment, a fundamental experiment in quantum mechanics, often used to demonstrate the wave-particle duality of light and matter. The project was submitted to Dr. Praveen Kumar as part of the course requirements.

Overview
The simulation is created using Python and utilizes the Pygame library for graphics rendering. It allows users to interact with various parameters of the double-slit experiment and observe the resulting interference patterns.

Features
Interactive Interface: Users can interact with the simulation by adjusting parameters such as the distance between the slits, wavelength of light, and slit width.

Real-time Visualization: The simulation provides real-time visualizations of the interference patterns generated by the double-slit experiment as the parameters are adjusted.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The GUI is implemented using Pygame and Tkinter, providing an intuitive way for users to interact with the simulation.

How to Use
Launching the Simulation: Run the Python script double_slit_simulation.py to launch the simulation.

Adjust Parameters: Use the mouse to adjust parameters such as the distance between the slits (D), wavelength of light (Î»), and slit width (d). Users can also input specific values for these parameters via text boxes.

Observing Results: As parameters are adjusted, observe the real-time visualizations on the screen to see how changes affect the interference patterns.

Additional Options: The simulation provides additional options such as resetting parameters to default values and accessing instructions for using the program.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pygame library
Tkinter library
